This project is an open source project that consists of an initiative to recreate Minecraft 100% from scratch in Rust, in a more optimized way. And of course, to make it 100% compatible with Minecraft Java. Same communication protocols, but in a more optimized version. This is a public project, anyone can make a pull-request, create forks... And the more visibility we get, the faster our project will get off the ground.

Compile the program using 
```sh-session
$ cargo run
``` 
to see how the project is currently doing. ðŸ’œ
